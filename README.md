# Problem-Solving Patterns for Technical Challenges

## Introduction

In the realm of coding challenges and technical interviews, the ability to identify and apply problem-solving patterns is invaluable. Recognizing these patterns can drastically reduce the time taken to solve problems and increase accuracy. These patterns act as templates that can be tweaked and applied to a wide range of problems, offering a strategic approach rather than relying on brute force or starting from scratch. This repository delves into 14 key patterns that will equip you with the necessary tools to ace any coding challenge.

### 1. **Sliding Window**

Used for array or list problems, the sliding window technique helps to find a subarray that satisfies certain conditions. It reduces the time complexity by 'sliding' over the data once rather than using nested loops.
