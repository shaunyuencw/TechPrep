# Sliding Window Pattern

The Sliding Window pattern is a popular technique in algorithms, especially for array or string problems. It involves maintaining a "window" of elements and sliding this window over the input to achieve the desired result.

## Summary

1.  **Main Idea:** Create a window of a certain size or condition and slide it through the input data (array, string, etc.) to find the best solution.
2.  **Optimization:** Helps convert problems from a brute-force solution with higher time complexity to more efficient solutions.

## Tips for Identifying Sliding Window Problems

1.  **Data Structure Involved:** The problem is based on a linear data structure like arrays, strings, or linked lists.
2.  **Seeking Contiguous Sequences:** Questions usually ask for the longest, shortest, or specific-sized subarray or substring.
3.  **Optimization is a Key:** You're trying to find a better solution than the obvious brute-force.

## Problem Examples

### Easy - Maximum Sum Subarray of Size 'K'

Find the maximum sum within a contiguous subarray of a given fixed size `K`.

**Solution Approach:** Start from the 1st element, maintain a running sum of size `K`, and slide the window by adjusting the sum accordingly.

### Medium - Longest Substring with 'K' Distinct Characters

Find the length of the longest substring with no more than 'K' distinct characters.

**Solution Approach:** Use a window to track distinct characters, expand the window to fit the condition, and shrink when necessary.

### Hard - String Anagrams

Given a string and a pattern, identify all starting indices of the pattern's anagrams in the string.

**Solution Approach:** Use a window the size of the pattern, maintain a frequency count of characters, and compare against the pattern's frequency.

## Final Thoughts

The Sliding Window technique is versatile and often reduces the time complexity of problems significantly. Recognizing problems that fit this pattern is a skill that can be honed with practice. As you solve more problems, the intuition to employ the sliding window approach will become more apparent.
